Hello there!

I'm a developer from São Paulo active in the following technologies:

 - 🐚 **Shell Script** (bash, zsh, ksh, busybox, TUIs, etc). I'm [constantly][mosai] [doing experiments][coral] [around it][shell-proto].
 - ☕ **Java** (i'm a newbie around here). [I'm working with it](http://github.com/mercadolibre) and learning along the way.
 - 🐘 **PHP**. My mother language. I'm mostly known for my free software work on it, but I've cooled down in the past few years.
 - 🐼 **Respect** (a [loose component framework][respect] I wrote). [One of the components][validation] is used a lot. A [friend](https://github.com/henriquemoody/) is now maintaining it.
 - 🐐 **elisp** (my intro to functional). I've tried to keep [a friendly emacs distro][tau]. It still works good but it needs some care.
 - 🟡 **JavaScript** (i'm rusty on this one). There is some [public stuff][concorde] which now belongs to the past.
