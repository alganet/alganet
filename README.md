Hello there!

I'm a developer from São Paulo interested in the following technologies (in no particular order):

 - 🐚 **Portable Shell Script** (bash, zsh, ksh, busybox, TUIs, etc). I'm [constantly][mosai] [doing experiments][coral] [around it][shell-proto]. It's my favorite language.
 - 🐘 **PHP**. My first language, working with it since version 4. I wrote a [popular validation library][validation] for it.
 - ☕ **Java** and **Kotlin**. I've worked with it for a couple of years. I really enjoy it's reactive programming APIs.
 - 🟡 **JavaScript**. I was there before jQuery, left before React arrived, and now I'm back at it. I know a little about some unusual runtimes (JScript, QuickJS, JXA).
 - 🔵 **TypeScript**. I'm learning it.
