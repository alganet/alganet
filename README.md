Hello there!

I'm a developer from São Paulo interested in the following technologies (in no particular order):

 - 🐚 **Portable Shell Script** (bash, zsh, ksh, busybox, TUIs, etc).
 - 🐘 **PHP**. My first language, working with it since version 4.
 - ☕ **Java** and **Kotlin**. I've worked with it for a couple of years.
 - 🟡 **JavaScript**. I was there before jQuery, left before React arrived, and now I'm back at it.
 - 🔵 **TypeScript**. I'm learning it.

Stuff I wrote that's worth mentioning:

 - 🐘 [Respect\Validation](https://github.com/Respect/Validation): Declarative validation DSL and a large number of built-in rules. 
 - 🐚 [alganet/shell-versions](https://github.com/alganet/shell-versions): Docker images for multiple shells and multiple versions. Ideal for testing shell scripts.
 - 🐃 [alganet/tau](https://github.com/alganet/tau): Emacs, but hacked to support natural CUA keybindings such as in VSCode or Sublime Text.
 - ✈️ [Aeronautics/Concorde](https://github.com/Aeronautics/Concorde): Early JavaScript isomorphic router, predates React by a few months.
