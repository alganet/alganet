Hello there!

I'm a developer from São Paulo interested in the following technologies:

 - 🐚 **Portable Shell Script** (bash, zsh, ksh, busybox, TUIs, etc). I'm [constantly][mosai] [doing experiments][coral] [around it][shell-proto]. It's my favorite language.
 - 🐘 **PHP**. My first language. I'm mostly known for my free software work on it. Working with it since version 4.
 - ☕ **Java** and **Kotlin**. I've worked with it in the past few years. I'm mostly interested in the reactive stuff now.
 - 🐼 **Respect** (a [loose component framework][respect] I wrote). [One of the components][validation] is used a lot. A [friend](https://github.com/henriquemoody/) maintained and improved it for a while.
 - 🐐 **elisp** (my first functional language). I've tried to keep [a friendly emacs distro][tau]. It still works good but it needs some care.
 - 🟡 **JavaScript**. I was there before jQuery, but left before react arrived. There is some [public stuff][concorde] which now belongs to the past.
